# How to Add Your DPU Logo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save the logo image** you sent earlier (the DPU logo with "CENTRE FOR ONLINE LEARNING")

2. **Rename it to:** `dpu-logo.png`

3. **Place it in this folder:** `c:\Users\ajitd\Desktop\ANTI\public\`

4. **Refresh your browser** - the logo will appear automatically!

## Alternative: Use the Image from Your Message

The logo image you sent in the chat can be:
1. Right-clicked
2. "Save image as..."
3. Save as `dpu-logo.png` in the `public` folder

---

## File Path Should Be:
```
c:\Users\ajitd\Desktop\ANTI\public\dpu-logo.png
```

Once this file exists, the logo will show on all pages:
- Landing page
- Login page
- Signup page
- Chat page
- Admin panel

The code is already updated and waiting for the logo file!
